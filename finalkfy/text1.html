Therefore, it is necessary to keep eating to maintain their metabolism. Hairless cats are very sensitive to sunlight because white areas are easy to tan. Because of their lack of hair, they have poor ability to regulate the outside temperature, both cold and hot. Keeping the cat at 25 to 30 degrees will make the cat feel very comfortable. </h1>
