breeders in Europe have been working on the Sphynx breed 
since the early 1960s. 
Two different sets of hairless felines discovered 
in North America in the 1970s 
provided the foundation cats for what was shaped into the existing Sphynx breed.

The contemporary breed of Sphynx cat, 
also known as the Canadian Sphynx,
 is distinct from the Russian hairless cat breeds like Peterbald and Donskoy. </h1>
